This package is part of the rOpenSci project, which has a defined process for
finding new maintainers for otherwise abandoned projects
(https://devguide.ropensci.org/changing-maintainers.html). 
On May 20 rOpenSci put out a call for new maintainers for geojsonio, and 
on May 31 I agreed to take over maintenance of the package 
(see https://github.com/ropensci/geojsonio/issues/178). My attempts to 
contact Scott on GitHub have been unsuccessful.
